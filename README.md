# Time-Series-Modeling
MITx - MicroMasters Program on Statistics and Data Science - Data Analysis: Statistical Modeling and Computation in Applications - Fourth Project

The fourth project of the MIT MicroMasters Program course on Data Analysis focused on time series  by forecasting with environmental and financial dataset. The objectives were to first carry a descriptive analysis with the help of visualizing the different components and their dependencies, handling the missing data with an adequate method and then move towards fitting and selecting a model in order to forecast into the future while also interpreting the results.

The first dataset consists recordings of the concentration of CO2 by Charles David Keeling at Mauna Loa, a volcano on the Hawaii island that he, and later his son, recorded since 1958 till now, making the most important data set in modern climate research.
